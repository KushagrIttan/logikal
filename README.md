## Description
LogiKal is a comprehensive solution to the compliance checking problem in logistics. It is a web-based application built using Streamlit for the UI and Python with JSON for the backend. The platform allows users to input shipment details such as origin, destination, and package information, and determines whether the shipment clears domestic or international compliance checks. 

## Features
- **Chatbot Assistance**: Provides real-time assistance to users for queries and guidance.
- **API Integration**: Enables seamless integration with other programs and corporate systems.
- **Shipment Logging with Blockchain**: Ensures shipment records are securely logged and protected using blockchain technology.
- **International Compliance Check**: Utilizes a Generative AI (GenAI) API for international shipment compliance.
- **Domestic Compliance Check**: Employs a trained classification machine learning model for domestic shipment compliance.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Truck Fleet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/saloni0511/truck-fleet-dataset) for training the machine learning model.
